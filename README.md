# Plant_Disease_Classification:
## 1. ABSTRACT:
The objective of this project is to develop an effective neural network-based model for the classification of plant diseases. We leverage deep learning techniques and a comprehensive plant disease dataset to address this critical problem in agriculture. Our approach involves the use of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to build and train the neural network model. I utilize a dataset comprising images of various plant species afflicted with different diseases. The model is trained to classify these images into disease categories, enabling automated disease detection in crops. This project underscores the importance of leveraging cutting-edge technologies like deep learning to address real-world challenges in agriculture. Accurate plant disease classification has the potential to revolutionize farming practices and contribute to global food production.
## 2.	SCOPE:
Pakistan is an Agricultural country and most of our economy is based on Agriculture. But every year most of our agricultural products are badly affected by different plant diseases. Diseases have a wide range of detrimental effects on plants leading to reduced crop yield, poor crop quality, and in some cases plant death. Identifying plant diseases at an early stage is crucial to prevent their spread. Rapid detection allows farmers to take timely action, such as applying treatments or implementing quarantine measures, to contain the disease and minimize crop loss. The goal of this project is to train a model on a plant disease dataset and learn whether a plant is Healthy, Rust or Powdery. The primary objective is to develop a robust neural network-based model capable of accurately classifying plant diseases based on input images. The scope includes creating a model that can differentiate between different diseases affecting various plant species. This will leverage the power of machine learning and neural networks to achieve this objective. MobileNet and EfficientNet are pre-trained neural networks capable of extracting valuable features from images. This means they can automatically recognize patterns and unique characteristics in the plant images, which can help distinguish healthy plants from those with diseases. Machine learning and neural networks enable the automation of plant disease detection. Farmers can simply take photos of their crops, and the system will quickly identify if there are any issues.
